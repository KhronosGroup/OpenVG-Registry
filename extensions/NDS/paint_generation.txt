Overview

    This extension is designed to support extended paint generation for vgDrawPath
    and vgDrawImage.

    OpenVG 1.0 supports gradient paint generation for non-linear color space in
    pre-multiplied and non pre-multiplied forms (sRGBA and sRGBA_PRE). This
    extension extends gradient paint generation to include the linear color space
    allowing gradients to be interpolated in lRGBA and lRGBA_PRE color spaces.

    This extension specifies an additional color transform stage for paint
    generation. This color transform allows a full 5x4 color transform matrix to
    be specified for a paint object. This color transform allows paint colors to
    be adjusted without recalculation of color values. Although solid paint, and
    in some implementations gradient paint, can have the color transform applied
    to the color values above the OpenVG API with no performance drop, this is
    not the case for pattern paint generation, or vgDrawImage operations, which
    would require new images to be generated and the color transform applied
    using vgColorMatrix. This is costly in terms of performance, memory
    footprint, and memory bandwidth. This extension removes these inefficiencies
    and allows a consistent way of applying color transforms to all paint
    generation.

    Within Section 9.2 Color Paint:
    after paragraph begining:
        "Color paint uses a fixed color ..."
    insert the following paragraphs:
        "   If the VG_PAINT_COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS flag is set to VG_TRUE,
        the color value is converted to linear color space (lRGBA), prior to
        applying the color transform specified by VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS.
        Otherwise the color transform specified by VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS is
        applied to the color value in the non-linear color space (sRGBA)."

    Within Section 9.3.3 Color Ramps:
    after paragraph begining:
        "If a color or alpha value ..."
    insert the following paragraphs:
        "   If the VG_PAINT_COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS flag is set to VG_TRUE,
        color values at each stop are converted to linear color space (lRGBA),
        prior to applying the color transform specified by VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS.
        Otherwise the color transform specified by VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS is
        applied to the color values at each stop in the non-linear color space
        (sRGBA).

            If the paints VG_PAINT_COLOR_RAMP_LINEAR_NDS flag is set to
        VG_TRUE, color transformed color values at each stop are converted
        to linear color space (lRGBA) prior to pre-multiplication and
        interpolation. Otherwise color values are converted to the non-linear
        color space (sRGBA) prior to pre-multiplication and interpolation."

    change sentence:
        "If the paint’s VG_PAINT_COLOR_RAMP_PREMULTIPLIED flag is set to
        VG_TRUE, color and alpha values at each gradient stop are multiplied
        together to form premultiplied sRGBA values prior to interpolation.
        Otherwise, color and alpha values are processed independently."
    to:
        "If the paint’s VG_PAINT_COLOR_RAMP_PREMULTIPLIED flag is set to
        VG_TRUE, color and alpha values at each gradient stop are multiplied
        together to form premultiplied sRGBA or premultiplied lRGBA values
        prior to interpolation. Otherwise, color and alpha values are
        processed independently."

    Within Section 9.4 Pattern Paint:
    after paragraph begining:
        "Interpolation may be performed between multiple pixels ..."
    insert the following paragraphs:
        "   If the VG_PAINT_COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS flag is set to VG_TRUE,
        the interpolated pixel values are converted to linear color space
        (lRGBA), prior to applying the color transform specified by
        VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS. Otherwise the interpolated pixel values are
        converted to non-linear color space (sRGBA), prior to applying the color
        transform specified by VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS. Pixel values in premultiplied
        alpha form are converted to non-premultiplied form prior to color
        transform. If the pattern tiling mode is set to VG_TILE_FILL and the
        VG_PAINT_COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS flag is set to VG_TRUE, the fill
        color is converted from sRGBA to lRGBA prior to applying the color
        transform specified by VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS."

    After Section 9.4 Pattern Paint:
    insert following section:
        "9.5 Color Transform
            A paint objects color transform matrix is set using vgSetParamter.
        The VG_PAINT_COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS parameter takes a VGboolean value
        and controls whether color and alpha values are transformed in linear
        (lRGBA) or non-linear (sRGBA) color space. The VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS
        paramter takes an array of twenty floating-point values supplied in the
        order {m00, m10, m20, m30, m01, m11, m21, m31, m02, m12, m22, m32,
        m03, m13, m23, m33, m04, m14, m24, m34}. The color transform computes
        output colors as the linear combination of color and alpha values (R,
        G, B, A) from the solid color, stop color, interpolated pixel
        color, or tile fill color:

            | Rct |   | m00 m01 m02 m03 | | R |   | m04 |
            | Gct |   | m10 m11 m12 m13 | | G |   | m14 |
            | Bct | = | m20 m21 m22 m23 |.| B | + | m24 |
            | Act |   | m30 m31 m32 m33 | | A |   | m34 |

        or

            Rct = m00.R + m01.G + m02.B + m03.A + m04
            Gct = m10.R + m11.G + m12.B + m13.A + m14
            Bct = m20.R + m21.G + m22.B + m23.A + m24
            Act = m30.R + m31.G + m32.B + m33.A + m34
        "

    Within Section 10.8:
    After sub-heading VG_DRAW_IMAGE_MULTIPLY
    insert following sub-heading and sub-section
        "VG_DRAW_IMAGE_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS
            When the VG_IMAGE_MODE parameter is set to VG_DRAW_IMAGE_COLOR_
        MATRIX_NDS, the interpolated pixel values of the image being drawn
        are converted to the non-premultipled color space specified by the
        current paints (the VGPaint object defined for the VG_FILL_PATH paint mode)
        VG_PAINT_COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS parameter (linear lRGBA if set to
        VG_TRUE or non-linear sRGBA otherwise). The converted values are then
        color transformed by the matrix specified in the current paints
        VG_COLOR_MATRIX_NDS parameter.
            The result considered to be in the color space specified by VG_PAINT_
        COLOR_TRANSFORM_LINEAR_NDS is used as the input to the current blend
        function and normal blending takes place."
